Led a groundbreaking POC on how to integrate and extend static SSRS reports with Angular and ship them as an NPM package. This package allowed front-end teams to add SSRS reports to their projects and use a set of widgets to add extra functionality to the reports (e.g. paging, drill-down, drill-through...)

At the end of each sprint, I took the responsibility of preparing and presenting a demo to the project's stakeholders.

The Dashboard is the team's most important product. It helps business personnel to track and analyze important KPI's. I helped modernize the product's tech stack, earlier written in AngularJs with Typescript, to Angular (5).

**Key technologies: AngularJs, Jasmine, Karma, Angular (5), Typescript, Lodash, RxJs, GIT**
