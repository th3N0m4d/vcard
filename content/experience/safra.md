As part of the initiative to revamp one of our leading products, I spiked and implemented a prototype of what became the department's first mobile project.

The fronted stack consisted of Framework7 as the presentation layer fully integrated with VueJs. The backend was also affected by this revamping. We designed, implemented, and tested the new API following RESTFul principles which were innovative within the bank.

Implemented a web scraper - written in C# and Cron - that automated repetitive manual queries on third party legacy systems.

Designed and co-authored a proprietary Workflow system written in AngularJs and Bootstrap.

Introduced best practices for querying and manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) with jQuery.

**Key technologies: AngularJs, jQuery, VueJs, Framework7, Quartz, Web Api, PL-SQL, Oracle, ASP.NET MVC, Simple Injector, Windows Services, SVN**
