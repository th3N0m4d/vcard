Helped define and implement the new programming guidelines for UI teams across the whole company. These guidelines served as a means to help front end teams to hit the ground running and create uniformity across the organization.

As part of the platform's team, I contributed to developing the React incarnation of the established Component's UI library originally written in pure HTML and CSS. The components were written in React and Styled Components and unit tested with Jest and Cypress. We also used Storybook to demo the components at the end of the product increment.

Tutored the team's first intern. He eventually got a contract deal after his 3-month training.

Participated as a speaker in one of our quarterly meetups. The topic was "Functional programming with Ramda".

**Key technologies: React, Styled Components, Bootstrap, Webpack 4, Jest, Redux, Storybook, Ramda, Jira, GIT, NPM**
