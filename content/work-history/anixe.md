### ECOM team

ECOM is responsible for maintaining a wide range of projects developed in a variety of different technology stacks.

Supported mainly a back-end system for our booking flight app. This system is written in NodeJs and Firebase.

**Key technologies: NodeJs, Firebase, Angular, VueJs, Jest, Sass, Postman**

### Code Assessment (still at ECOM)

Helped raise awareness about several quality issues regarding a project which is going to be handed over to us by a third party firm.

Showed actual code from the repository with its corresponding anti-pattern. These anti-patterns were grouped into three categories: programming, methodological, and architectural anti-patterns.

This initiative was praised by our management and led our business unit to request immediate changes to the source code before the handover.

### VASCO team

Due to budget cuts caused by the pandemic, temporarily had to join another team called Vasco. This team is responsible for developing and maintaining an online travel agency application, an in-house component's library, and a back-office portal (all of which I had the chance to work with).

As of this moment, I'm implementing a new module that will allow our users to search for cars for rental (akin to RentalCars.com).

**Key technologies: Angular 10, NGRx Store, Responsive Web Design, Sasss, Jasmine**

### Blog posts

Within the span of two months of joining the company, authored and shared articles about emerging technologies, such as: Testing Firebase Cloud Functions (three-part series) - Authentication with VueJs and Firebase - Automated E2E tests with Postman
